<h1>RemoteCTRL</h1>

This is the documentation/prototyping page for the Android RemoteCTRL project. Start date April 28, 2013.

<h2>Overview</h2>


In a typical home theatre system, there are too many remotes: tv, dvd/bluray, amplifier, cable, sat, and possiblity things like xbox, PS3, and HTPC. Whenever this is the case, turning on the and coordinating an intent such as "I want to watch my bluray" or "I want to play xbox" becomes a combination challenge. This project aims to solve that problem.
